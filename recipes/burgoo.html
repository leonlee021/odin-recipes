        <h3>Description</h3>
        I scaled this recipe back a little (there are just 2 of us). I used lean farm-raised (longhorn lean) stewing beef and farm-raised pork. 
        I didn't used chicken or chicken broth - I used beef broth. I used all spices recommended by this recipe, including Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce. 
        Except for the onion, carrot and potato, I use whatever vegetables we like - it's all good. Serve with sweet corn bread and honey butter. YUMMMMM!
